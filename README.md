# [Introduction To AlphaFold2](./README.md)

## Description 

This course gives a high level overview of the AlphaFold 2 algorithm with the goal of using it on the Tufts HPC cluster to predict and analyze protein structures. For support with this workshop please contact [tts-research@tufts.edu](mailto:ltts-research@tufts.edu).

## Goals

## Prerequisites

### Computational skills needed

## Acknowledgement

Much of this course has been adapted from the [VIB Bioinformatics Core AlphaFold2 Tutorial](https://elearning.bits.vib.be/courses/alphafold/). We would also like to thank the [Oxford Protein Informatics Group](https://www.blopig.com/blog/2021/07/alphafold-2-is-here-whats-behind-the-structure-prediction-miracle/) for their digestible take on the AlphaFold2 algorithm.
