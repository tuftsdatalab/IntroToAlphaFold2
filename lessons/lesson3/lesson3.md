## Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PNCA)

In the previous lesson we demonstrated how to put together a batch script to run the alphafold program. However, since it can take quite a bit of time to run we will be working with output from an AlphaFold 2 prediction. But first let's get acquainted with the protein we will be working with today, Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PNCA). PNCA is a very well conserved protein across eukaryotes and even Archea. It acts as a processivity factor of DNA Polymerase delta, necessary for DNA replication:

Aside from DNA replication PNCA is involved in:

* chromatin remodelling 
    
* DNA repair
    
* sister-chromatid cohesion

* cell cycle control

It should also be noted that PNCA is a multimeric protein consisting of three monomers. We will now determine how well AlphaFold did at predicting it's structure.
