## Log into the HPC clusterâ€™s On Demand Interface

- Open a Chrome browser and go to [On Demand](https://ondemand.pax.tufts.edu/)
- Log in with your Tufts Credentials
- On the top menu bar choose `Clusters->Tufts HPC Shell Access`

![](images/shell.PNG)

- You'll see a welcome message and a bash prompt, for example for user `tutln01`:

```
[tutln01@login001 ~]$
```

- This indicates you are logged in to the login node of the cluster. Please **do not** run any program from the login node.

## Starting an Interactive Session

- To run our analyses we will need to move from the login node to a compute node. We can do this by entering:

```
srun --pty -t 3:00:00 --mem 16G -N 1 --cpus 4 bash
```

Where:

|`command`|description|
|-|-|
|`srun`|SLURM command to run a parallel job|
|`--pty`| get a pseudo terminal|
|`-t` | time we need here we request 3 hours|
|`--mem` | memory we need here we request 16 Gigabytes|
|`-N` | number of nodes needed here we requested 1 node|
|`--cpus` | number of CPUs needed here we requested 4|

- When you get a compute node you'll note that your prompt will no longer say login and instead say the name of the node:

```
[tutln01@c1cmp048 ~]$
```

## Getting Our Data

- To get our AlphaFold data we will enter:

```
cp -r /cluster/tufts/bio/tools/tool_examples/af2Workshop ./
```

- You will note that we are copying an existing directory with AlphaFold output rather than generating it. This is because depending on the protein and compute resource availability, running AlphaFold can take a few hours to over a day. At the end of this workshop will be instructions for creating a batch script to run AlphaFold.
