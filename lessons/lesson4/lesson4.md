## Visualizing With Pymol

- In the previous slide we plotted our MSA alignment, the pLDDT scores, and the predicted alignement error. However, it is also useful to visualize the actual predicted protein structure and compare it to the known structure. Here we use a software called PyMOL to do just that.
